            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Ben Pavlis. I grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota and graduated from Luther College with a bachelors degree in the field of sociology. One of my favorite things in the world is following sports as I grew up loving to play them. I played football, baseball, and hockey until I decided to focus all my energy into baseball, quitting the other two. I still follow and am a fan of all the Minnesota sports teams except for the Vikings as I am unfortunately a Chicago Bears fan due to some family persuasion when I was younger. <br><br>In addition to sports, I love to play video games with some of my favorites over the years being Call of Duty, Madden, 2K, MLBTheShow, Assassins Creed, Fortnite, Warzone, Minecraft, PokemonGo, and many more. Kicking back after a long day of school/work and turning on my PS5 is one of my favorite activities, especially because it allows for me to stay connected with friends I otherwise may have lost contact with due to different directions life takes people.<br><br>I recently seriously got into the world of computer programming which is where I found a bootcamp through the UofM. Below are examples of projects we ended up working on.</p>
